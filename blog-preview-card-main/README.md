## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex

### What I learned

Learned more about clamp() and element aligment

### Continued development

I had some matching the design as close as possible, espcially with size, padding and margin.
I had to put the design next to the rendered website and try to match by observing the differences.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me learn and discover some nice CSS tricks like @media and list-style
